\chapter{Methodology}

\label{chapter4}

In this chapter, we discuss about the techniques and methods used to devise an experiment involving a Pt-Cu bilayer system and subsequently investigate the effect of spin current via SHE.

\section{Experimental plan} \label{sec:plan}

In earlier studies, it has been shown that a pure spin current can be generated and manipulated via a heavy metal through SHE \cite{hirsch1999spin,sinova2004universal,zhang2000spin}. The detection of this spin current can only be done via conversion into charge current (which is measurable) using ISHE. This generally involves a ferromagnetic layer or a magneto-optical method \cite{kimura2007room,li2019spin,stamm2017magneto,valenzuela2007electrical}.

In our study, we intend to explore the detection of spin current in a NM/HM trilayer system without a magnetic layer, i.e. via electrical means such as using a simple voltmeter.

In many studies involving the electrical detection of spin current, pure spin current is generated using a ferromagnet at one end of the sample structure, which then gets converted to charge current via ISHE, and is subsequently, detectable using a voltmeter at the other end of the structure (which is usually a non-magnetic metal with high spin-orbit coupling).

Contrary to the above method, we do not generate pure spin current beforehand, but rather provide a pure charge current as supply to our sample, which is converted to spin current via SHE and is converted back to charge current via ISHE. Keeping this in mind, we design our sample accordingly.

\section{Preparation of sample}

We prepare a trilayer system, using copper (Cu) as the NM and platinum (Pt) as the HM. Here, we sandwich a layer of Cu between two layers of Pt. This is depicted in \cref{layers}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw [fill={rgb:black,1;white,4}] (0,0) rectangle (5,3);
    \node at (2.5,2.5) {Pt};
    \draw [fill={rgb:orange,1;yellow,2;pink,5}] (0,0) rectangle (5,2);
    \node at (2.5,1.5) {Cu};
    \draw [fill={rgb:black,1;white,4}] (0,0) rectangle (5,1);
    \node at (2.5,0.5) {Pt};
    \draw (-1,0) -- (6,0);
    \node at (2.5,-0.5) {SiO$_2$};
\end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Side view of the trilayer sample}
    \label{layers}
\end{figure}

Now, as mentioned in \cref{sec:plan}, we intend to make the shape of our sample to facilitate the conversion to charge to spin current and vice versa.
Now, as seen in %insert section depicting SHE and ISHE regarding perpendicular conversion
we see that converted spin current, flows perpendicular to the original charge current and similarly during the back conversion via ISHE.
For this, an obvious structural shape would be a path that has two paths, connected via a link being perpendicular to both the paths simultaneously.
Hence, a \textsc{H}-like structure comes to mind, which is implemented in our experimental setup.

Through this method, the layer of Cu and Pt are deposited on the Si$O_2$ wafer at an even thickness, to make the whole sample.

\section{Detecting spin current}

In the case of OHE, the charge imbalance across the edges of the slab results in a potential difference (Hall voltage) \( V_H \) across the width of the sample.
This voltage can then simply be measured using a voltmeter.
But in the case of SHE, how does one go about measuring spin imbalance?
In such a case, there is no net charge transfer and hence conventional electrical measurements cannot be used directly.

One plausible way would be to use an instrument to measure the difference in localized magnetization across the width of the slab.
This can be achieved by using a superconducting quantum interference device microscope \cite{black1993magnetic} to measure local magnetic fields; the details into which we shall not go over for the sake of brevity.
A potential difficulty that arises in this approach would be to eliminate the contribution of magnetic field due to the longitudinal current density \( j_x \), it being greater in magnitude would mask the magnetization along the edges due to spin polarized electrons \cite{hirsch1999spin}.

We proceed to highlight a clever method to measure the spin current in a sample as proposed in \cite{hirsch1999spin}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{hirsch.png}
    \caption{Schematic diagram depicting method to measurement of spin current.\\ \vspace{0.2cm} \textit{Image courtesy: JE Hirsch. ``Spin Hall effect" Phys. rev. letters (1999)}}
    \label{fig:hirsch-measure}
\end{figure}

The same scattering mechanisms (refer \cref{sec:mechanisms}) responsible for the conversion of charge current to spin current in the first place, will also be responsible for the conversion in the reverse direction i.e. ISHE.
This fact is exploited and we argue that by connecting a transverse strip across the slab would allow spin current to flow through it (as seen in \cref{fig:hirsch-measure}.

We take this strip made of a material (metal) with high SOC, only then can one observe ISHE to convert spin polarized electrons to a charge imbalance across width of strip.
Let charge current density \( j_x \) travel along the longitudinal direction.
The width of the slab is \( L \) and the width of the transverse strip is \( l \).
It is a necessary point to note that the width \( L \) cannot be more than the spin diffusion length \( \delta_s \) of the material of the slab.
\( \delta_s \) is the maximum length of a material, upto which spin coherence of spin polarized electrons is maintained.
Scattering mechanisms responsible for the phenomena, also lead to a loss of this spin coherence across a length scale given by \( \delta_s \), which is an intrinsic property of the material used.

As seen in the figure, charge current corresponding to \( j_x \) results in a spin imbalance across the edges of the slab due to SHE.
This results in spin current\footnote{Described in the preliminary sections (refer \cref{sec:she})}.

This spin current moves in a perpendicular direction compared to \( j_x \) but in the plane of the slab.
Via the same scattering mechanisms, the spin polarized electrons get preferentially scattered depending on the direction of their spins, resulting in a charge imbalance which is seen along the edges of the tranverse metal strip.
This charge imbalance gives rise to a potential difference across the strip, which can be measured by conventional electrical instruments such as a voltmeter.

\subsubsection{Mathematical formulation of spin voltage}

The magnetization of a sample with \( n_{\downarrow} \) as the number density of spin polarized (spin down) electrons is given by

\begin{equation}
    M = n_{\downarrow} \mu_B
\end{equation}

where \( \mu_B \) is the Bohr magneton.

Along with the longitudinal current density \( j_x \), we get an anomalous Hall voltage across the width of the sample as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ano-hall-voltage}
    V_H = 4 R_s L j_x n_{\downarrow} \mu_B
\end{equation}

where \( R_s \) is the anomalous Hall coefficient and \( L \) is the transverse width of the slab.

\Cref{eq:ano-hall-voltage} can be extended for non-magnetic materials with high SOC, where the number density of spin \( \downarrow \) and spin \( \uparrow \) electrons is equal, giving rise to a ``spin Hall voltage" \( V_{SH} \), whose sign depends on the direction of spin of the electrons.
This gives us the corresponding expression as,

\begin{equation}
    V_{SH} = 2 \pi R_s L j_x n \mu_B
\end{equation}

where \( n \) is the total number density of conduction electrons and the rest of symbols have their usual meanings.


\section{Measurement}

After the sample is prepared, we pass electrical (pure charge) current through one arm of the \textit{H}-structure and make voltage measurements across the opposite ends of the sample, as shown in \cref{fig:measurement}. This is technically called a non-local measurement.

\subsection{Efficacy of the measurement}

As seen in \cref{subsec:spin-angle}, the efficiency of conversion of spin current to charge current and vice versa is related to the spin Hall angle of the material.
However, this efficiency is very poor in practical laboratory environments.
Earlier studies in measuring spin current \cite{valenzuela2007electrical}, involved using a ferromagnetic layer to generate the spin polarized electrons, giving rise to spin current which is converted to charge current further down the experiment via ISHE.
In these studies, the conversion occurs only once, in contrast to our study where we do this to-and-fro conversion \textbf{twice}, meaning that the efficacy of measuring the spin current is much less as compared to traditional approaches \cite{valenzuela2007electrical}.

\subsection{Final step}

After making the measurement of potential difference via voltmeter, the measurement readings are analyzed.\footnote{Done in the following chapter.}
