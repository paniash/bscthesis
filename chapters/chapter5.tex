After making the aforementioned measurements, we proceed to analyze the resultant data.

    \caption{Variation of voltage for a range of temperature (\( \approx 2 \: K \) to \( 10 \: K \) at constant currents 1 \( \mu \)A and 500 \( \mu \)A).}
    \label{fig:vt}
\end{figure}

On measuring the voltage for a range of temperature (from 2 K to 10 K) at a constant temperature of 1 \( \mu \)A, we see significant noise in \cref{fig:vt} with no particular behaviour. However, doing the same experimental run for a current of 500 \( \mu \)A, we observe a better plot as compared to the case of 1 \( \mu \)A. However, even this plot does not yield any inferable data.

    \label{fig:vh-compare}
\end{figure}

On varying the input current from -2 mA to +2 mA at a temperature of 2 $K$, we observe that there is a random variation of non-local voltage measurement in \cref{fig:vh-compare} for a number of runs of the experiment. This also yields no inferable data.
