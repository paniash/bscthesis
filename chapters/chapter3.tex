\chapter{A semiclassical approach to SHE}

\label{chapter3}

In this chapter, we shall look at the semi-classical picture of SHE and try to understand the mechanisms behind SHE, which are mainly classified into intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

\section{Relation with AHE}

As seen in \cref{sec:ohe}, the OHE results in a charge imbalance along the edges of the conductor in the presence of an external magnetic field. We have also seen that in the case of SHE (sec \ref{sec:she}), instead of a charge imbalance, we see a spin imbalance i.e. a preferential accumulation along the edges of the material.




\section{Mechanisms behind the phenomena}

Over the past century, the spintronics community has agreed upon three plausible mechanisms responsible for SHE.
