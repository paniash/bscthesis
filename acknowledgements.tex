I would like to take this opportunity to thank my supervisor, Dr. Kartik Senapati, for supervising me for my sixth semester project. His guidance and constructive feedback helped me in improving my work.

I would also like to especially thank my collaborator, Mr. Tapas Ranjan Senapati, who guided me in working with the instruments and made sure that I understood the relevant concepts required for the project.
