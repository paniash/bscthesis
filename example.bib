abstract={THE statement that ``the mechanical force which urges a conductor carrying a current across the lines of magnetic force, acts, not on the electric current, but on the conductor which carries it,'' has often been a puzzle to students of electricitiy. Experiments have beenmade at various times to prove that the statement is not correct, but have hitherto uniformly resulted in failure. Mr. E. H. Hall working under the direction of Prof. Rowland believes himself to have been more forlunate than his predecessor, and describes an experiment which apparently proves a permanent effect of a magnet on the, distribution of currents in a system of wires. As Mr. Hall promises a more extended investigation we shall describe his experiment as much as possible in his own words without comment or criticism.},
