\chapter{Results}

We make the following measurements at varying:

\begin{itemize}
    \item thickness of Pt and Cu layers; (10 nm, 20 nm, $\ldots$ )
    \item length and width of arm of the \Hst.
\end{itemize}

\label{chapter5}

After making the aforementioned measurements, we proceed to analyze the resultant data.

    \caption{Variation of voltage as a function of temperature at constant input current.}
    \label{fig:ohm}
\end{figure}

Before the experiment is begun, we test if the sample track works as expected.
We supply a fixed value of input current and make voltage measurements at various temperatures of the sample.
As expected, we end up with a \textit{voltage-vs-temperature} curve which is characteristic to that of a metal (Cu/Pt) (see \cref{fig:ohm}).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{vt.jpg}
    \caption{Variation of voltage for a range of temperature (\( \approx 2 \: K \) to \( 10 \: K \) at constant currents 1 \( \mu \)A and 500 \( \mu \)A).}
    \label{fig:vt}
\end{figure}

On measuring the voltage for a range of temperature (from 2 K to 10 K) at a constant temperature of 1 \( \mu \)A, we see significant noise in \cref{fig:vt} with no particular behaviour. However, doing the same experimental run for a current of 500 \( \mu \)A, we observe a better plot as compared to the case of 1 \( \mu \)A. However, even this plot does not yield any inferable data.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{vt-normal.jpg}
    \caption{Testing voltage as a function of temperature against background.}
    \label{fig:bg}
\end{figure}

To check if the poor accuracy in plot \ref{fig:vt} is due to stray background potential, we measure it at 0.3 \( \mu \)A, and observe that the variation in voltage in \cref{fig:bg} shows no correspondence with plot \ref{fig:vt}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{vh-compare.jpg}
    \caption{At \( T = 2 \) K, variation of potential difference as input current is varied from -2 mA to +2 mA for a finite number of runs.}
    \label{fig:vh-compare}
\end{figure}

On varying the input current from -2 mA to +2 mA at a temperature of 2 K, we observe that there is a random variation of non-local voltage measurement in \cref{fig:vh-compare} for a finite number of runs of the experiment. This as well, yields no inferable data.

\subsection{Measurement via extrapolation in the presence of external \( B \) field}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \input{nonlocal-with-field.pgf}
    \caption{Plot of voltage \( V \) vs external magnetic field \( B \), in presence of an external magnetic field}
    \label{fig:b-extrapolation}
\end{figure}

As suggested in \cref{subsubsec:extrapolation}, we expected to observe a predictable pattern which could then be extrapolated to find the intercept on the \( y \)-axis (voltage measurement).
However, a very noisy data was observed with no scope for extrapolation (see \cref{fig:b-extrapolation}).


\subsection{Inference}

We notice that no significant deviation from the above measurement data is seen when varying the length of the arm-link of the \Hst, as long as the length is within the spin diffusion length of Cu.

At varying thickness of the layers, as predicted in \cref{subsec:thickness} and \cref{eq:thin-slab}, we observe a better signal strength at a thickness of 10 nm, as compared to thicker slabs.
