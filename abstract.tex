    Numerous studies on detecting spin current involve either using optical methods such as Kerr microscopy or use electrical detection methods where a spin current is generated beforehand and subsequent detection is done.

    In contrast to these methods, we employ a rather simpler version by using electrical detection methods to measure spin current by a priori supplying an electric current with which we generate and measure the resultant spin current with a nano voltmeter.
